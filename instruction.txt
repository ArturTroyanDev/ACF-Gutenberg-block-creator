To start using:

1. Add the create-block.js file to your project
2. npm install fs-extra
3. Add "scripts": {
"create-block": "node create-block.js"
} in package.json
4. Run the script: npm run create-block file-name

If the block does not appear in the admin, you must save block.json and the file in the place where you registered the block. My widget has functions.php
